                        scenario, there may be situation where the Manager of a company wants to check 
                        his employee&#8217;s status frequently in some time intervals. So in that situation, 
                        it may not be that feasible if the manager goes frequently to the employee and 
                        checks the status of that employee and this makes the employee to feel uneasy 
                        about his manager. Evaluating this scenario, we are trying to develop a Desktop 
                        Application where the screen shot of the system is taken frequently in the given 
                        time interval and mailed it to the specified mailed address. In this scenario, 
                        the manager may not find it difficult to go to the employees each and every time 
                        and make the employee feel uneasy about him. <o:p></o:p></span></span>
